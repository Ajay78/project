	The feature of this project is to add customer account, modify it and make transaction which also include viewing the existing customer list and updating their information and checking the account detail of customer.
	To do all of this whole work project contain an structure which store the data base of customer which also contain character array, another struct and integer and float datatype.
	First upon I started with what i need to store information of customer so create an structure which contain int float character array etc data dype. 
	Then I was in trouble for updating an existing customer info, b'coz when i tried to update address and phone no i can't store it and update it all i is to be need is another structuure to store updated data of customer. 
	So after that i get understand to do my project what should i need and what shoud i have to change. 
	In this program i use a simple data type to store and modify data.
